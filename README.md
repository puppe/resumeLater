resumeLater is an extension for Mozilla Firefox. It lets you bookmark videos on
Youtube and saves your current position. It allows you to resume playback at
that position.

## Supported Sites

 * Youtube

## Development

Tools recommended for development:

* [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext)
* [JSHint](https://jshint.com/install/)
* [Python test runner for Jasmine
  tests](https://jasmine.github.io/setup/python.html)

A shell.nix file is provided. If you are on NixOS or use Nix on any other
distribution / operating system, you can simply run `nix-shell` to get a shell
with the necessary dependencies. For even more convenience, you can use
[direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/Nix).

If you do not use Nix, you have to install these tools via npm, pip or any
other package manager that provides them.

### Running the extension, building the extension, etc.

See [this introduction to
web-ext](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/)
from Mozilla.

### Running tests

```
make test
```

That starts a web server at http://localhost:8888 and should open that URL in
your default browser.

### Linting

web-ext can do some linting specifically for Firefox web extensions.

```
web-ext lint
```

JSHint is used to enforce further syntactic rules.

```
jshint .
```

resumeLater uses [elementary Icons](https://launchpad.net/elementaryicons).
