Note about colors for the future:

I have read this article:
https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/how-to-choose-color-for-your-website/
And I picked #ABC443 as the dominant color. That is the color from the
resumeLater icon. Then I used
https://color.adobe.com/de/create/color-wheel/ to get additional colors
for accentuation. (Although, currently I only use a darker variant of
the dominant color for links.)

For background and text, mostly neutral colors (R=G=B, gray) are used.
